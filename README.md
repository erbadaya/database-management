# database-management
This code was developed to maintain a larga database of Prolific IDs to prevent participants to take part in a given study given their status on another studies run on Prolific. Importantly, it is specific to that lab at it requires a data dictionary - that part of code is highlighted and can be modified to meet other people's needs.
